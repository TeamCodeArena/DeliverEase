## Introduction
DeliverEase is built on the foundation of **empowering delivery partners**, enabling them to earn income while providing **efficient delivery services** to the community. By **bridging the gap between buyers and sellers directly**, DeliverEase eliminates the need for intermediaries, leading to **faster deliveries** and **reduced costs**.

## How it Works
### Order Placement
1. **Click Order:** To place an order, Buyers can click on the **"Order Something" button** on the homepage, which will lead them to the **order details page**

2. **Enter Delivery Details:** On the order details page, the Buyer can specify the **delivery location**, **preferred delivery time**, and any **additional information** relevant to the delivery

3. **Pickup Information:** They can also **provide pickup details**, including the **location and time** when the delivery partner should collect the item for delivery

4. **Submit Order:** After providing all the necessary information, the Buyer can **submit the order request**

### Post a Job
1. **Post a Job:** Sellers can post delivery jobs by **clicking on the "Post a Job" option on the homepage**

2. **Job Details:** They must **enter the job specifics**, including the **item to be delivered**, **pickup location**, **delivery location**, and **expected delivery time**

3. **Delivery Partner Assignment:** Once the job is posted, the nearest available delivery partner will have the option to accept the job **`(algorithms are still to be developed)`**

### Acceptance and Delivery
1. **Delivery Partner Selection:** The nearest available delivery partner can **view available jobs and accept** the ones that match their location and schedule

2. **Order Confirmation:** Once the delivery partner accepts the job the delivery process will begin

3. **Delivery Execution:** The delivery partner will **collect the item from the buyer's specified pickup location** and **deliver it to the buyer's specified delivery address**

4. **Confirmation from both sides:** You will get an **OTP at our website**, tell that to seller so that we can know that this order is completed

5. **Delivery Completion:** Once the delivery is successfully completed, both the buyer and seller will **receive notifications of the successful order**

## Key Features
