## Introduction

DeliverEase is built on the foundation of empowering delivery partners, enabling them to earn income while providing efficient delivery services to the community. By bridging the gap between buyers and sellers directly, DeliverEase eliminates the need for intermediaries, leading to faster deliveries and reduced costs.

## How it Works

### Order Placement

1. **Click Order:** To place an order, Buyers can click on the "Order Something" button on the homepage, which will lead them to the order details page

2. **Enter Delivery Details:** On the order details page, the Buyer can specify the delivery location, preferred delivery time, and any additional information relevant to the delivery

3. **Pickup Information:** They can also provide pickup details, including the location and time when the delivery partner should collect the item for delivery

4. **Submit Order:** After providing all the necessary information, the Buyer can submit the order request

### Post a Job

1. **Post a Job:** Sellers can post delivery jobs by clicking on the "Post a Job" option on the homepage

2. **Job Details:** They must enter the job specifics, including the item to be delivered, pickup location, delivery location, and expected delivery time

3. **Delivery Partner Assignment:** Once the job is posted, the nearest available delivery partner will have the option to accept the job (algorithms are still to be developed)

### Acceptance and Delivery

1. **Delivery Partner Selection:** The nearest available delivery partner can view available jobs and accept the ones that match their location and schedule

2. **Order Confirmation:** Once the delivery partner accepts the job the delivery process will begin

3. **Delivery Execution:** The delivery partner will collect the item from the buyer's specified pickup location and deliver it to the buyer's specified delivery address

4. **Confirmation from both sides:** You will get an OTP at our website, tell that to seller so that we can know that this order is completed

5. **Delivery Completion:** Once the delivery is successfully completed, both the buyer and seller will receive notifications of the successful order
